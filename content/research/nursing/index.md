Nursers and caregivers are experiencing thermal uncomfortness when they wear Physical Protective Equipment (PPE) to take care of patients, which cause them unwilling to wear PPE and being exposed  to hazards. I assembled a  sensory kit based on Raspberry Pi to measure the micro-environment in nursers' and caregivers' N95 masks and double-layered gloves during ambulatory oncology care. The experiment was conducted in School of Nursing Multi-professional Oncology Safety Simulation and Training Workshop.
